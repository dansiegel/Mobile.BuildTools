It solves the issue of case sensitivity in which some build agents like to run ToUpper() on all variable names making it utterly impossible to properly generate the secrets.json properly without a script. It makes things just a little less magical so that other developers can more quickly generate the secrets.json in the appropriate projects to get started. It makes it possible to support more property types as v2.X now supports all primitives, Uri, Guid, TimeSpan, DateTime, & DateTimeOffset, plus the option to use an array for any property type. We can configure the secrets for all of the projects in our solution by providing a value with the Project name and the appropriate configuration in the buildtools.json which should be located in the same directory as our solution file. Note that the following configuration will enable the Secrets task to run for a project named AwesomeApp in your solution. All other projects in the solution will not run the Secrets tasks. { \"$schema\" : \"https://mobilebuildtools.com/schemas/v2/buildtools.schema.json\" , \"projectSecrets\" : { \"AwesomeApp\" : { \"delimiter\" : \";\" , \"disable\" : false , \"className\" : \"Secrets\" , \"namespace\" : \"Helpers\" , \"properties\" : [ { \"name\" : \"SampleString\" , \"type\" : \"String\" , \"isArray\" : false }, { \"name\" : \"SampleBool\" , \"type\" : \"bool\" , \"isArray\" : false }, { \"name\" : \"SampleInt\" , \"type\" : \"int\" , \"isArray\" : false }, { \"name\" : \"SampleDouble\" , \"type\" : \"double\" , \"isArray\" : false }, { \"name\" : \"SampleUri\" , \"type\" : \"Uri\" , \"isArray\" : false }, { \"name\" : \"SampleDateTime\" , \"type\" : \"DateTime\" , \"isArray\" : false }, ] } } Note The configuration shown here is verbose. As long as the Properties are specified with a name and type the rest of the values shown here will default to the values shown.
