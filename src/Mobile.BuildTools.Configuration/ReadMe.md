# Mobile.BuildTools.Configuration

This package provides support for AppConfiguration that uses the classic app.config format to allow compile time or runtime configuration of your application. When using the app.config format this allows you to update your configuration at runtime without needing to recompile your application empowering scenarios where you may want to swap between Production and Stage environments in a live application. This is particularly useful in testing live applications where you may want to validate backend changes will not adversly affect your users.
