# Mobile.BuildTools.Images

This package provides support for image management in your mobile applications. This package is designed to work with any mobile application project type including .NET MAUI, .NET Mobile, Uno Platform and Avalonia applications. Unlike Resizetizer, the Mobile.BuildTools Images package is designed to be significantly more flexible with providing image overlays and json configurations that are much more natural for developers with full intellisense support.
